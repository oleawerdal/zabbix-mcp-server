"""OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server provider for the MCP server.

Implements the ``OAuthAuthorizationServerProvider`` protocol from the
MCP framework so that ChatGPT custom apps, Claude Desktop remote
connectors, and any other MCP 2025-11-25 compliant client can finish
their handshake against this server without operators having to bolt
on a separate IdP.

Architecture:

* The MCP server itself is the resource server (RS), the authorization
  server (AS), and the user identity backend, all in one process.
  Tokens are opaque (random hex), held in memory; since AS == RS,
  there is no need for JWT signing or JWKS to bridge a trust boundary.
* User authentication reuses the admin-portal users (scrypt hashes
  in ``/etc/zabbix-mcp/config.toml``).  Operators do not maintain a
  second identity store.
* Dynamic client registration (RFC 7591) is enabled by default;
  registered clients persist in ``[oauth_clients.<client_id>]``
  config sections so they survive a server restart.  Authorization
  codes (10-min TTL) and refresh tokens are in-memory only.
* The ``aud`` (resource indicator, RFC 8707) on every issued access
  token is bound to the canonical MCP URL declared via
  ``[server].public_url`` -- a token issued for one MCP deployment
  cannot be replayed against another.
* The legacy single-token / multi-token bearer mode keeps working:
  ``load_access_token`` first tries the OAuth-issued token cache and
  falls back to the existing ``TokenStore`` so a token configured as
  ``[tokens.<id>]`` can be used as a Bearer credential alongside
  OAuth tokens.

What it does NOT do (deferred):

* No JWT issuance / JWKS endpoint -- not required while AS == RS.
  If we later split the AS off the MCP host, swap opaque tokens for
  RS256 JWTs and add a ``/oauth/jwks.json`` route.
* No token introspection (RFC 7662) -- ``load_access_token`` is the
  in-process equivalent; clients never call introspection because the
  RS is local.
* No PAR (RFC 9126) -- not required by the MCP 2025-11-25 spec; can
  be added later if a client needs it.

    Args:
        public_url: Canonical https URL the MCP server is reachable on
            (e.g. ``https://mcp.example.com``).  Used as the issuer for
            metadata documents and as the ``aud`` value on every issued

            clients that already authenticate with a static
            ``[tokens.<id>]`` bearer keep working when OAuth is enabled.
        login_path: Path on the same host the AS will redirect users to
            for credential entry, e.g. ``"/oauth/login"``.  The login
            view receives ``?request_id=...`` and is responsible for
            calling ``complete_pending`` once the user authenticates.
        registered_clients_loader: Callable returning a dict mapping
            ``client_id -> OAuthClientInformationFull``.  Called once at
            startup; subsequent ``register_client`` calls are persisted
            via ``register_client_persister``.
        register_client_persister: Callable that writes a newly
