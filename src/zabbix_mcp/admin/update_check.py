"""Lazy GitHub release check for the admin-portal update banner.

The check fires:
  1. once at server boot (best-effort so the banner reflects reality
     even before anyone logs in), and
  2. on every successful admin login (see ``AdminApp._login`` ->
     ``trigger_async``), throttled to one outbound call per
     CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS so a burst of logins or a reload loop
     won't hammer the public GitHub rate limit (60 unauth req/h/IP).
  3. on demand via ``/api/check-updates`` (admin/operator role) which
     calls ``force_check()`` and bypasses the throttle. Wired to the
     "Check now" button next to the version pill in the header so an
     operator who just upgraded does not have to wait out the
     throttle to confirm they are on the latest version.

The result is cached in memory and persisted to
``/etc/zabbix-mcp/state/version-cache.json`` so a restart does not
lose the last known answer (survives the case where GitHub is
briefly unreachable). Idle deployments with no admin sessions and
no manual checks make zero outbound calls.

Privacy note: this is the only outbound request the admin portal
makes. It is documented in config.example.toml and
``[admin].update_check_enabled = false`` disables it cleanly. Failures
(offline, GitHub rate-limited, DNS, TLS) are silent so the banner
never causes a noisy log; we just keep showing the previous result.
